# Web-Automation-of-Prothoma-Bookshop-Website-Using-Page-Object-Model
This project demonstrates web automation of the **Prothoma Bookshop** website using **Selenium WebDriver** with **Java** and **TestNG**. The **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern is implemented to ensure maintainability, scalability, and reusability of the code.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to automate interactions with the Prothoma Bookshop website, such as browsing books, searching for specific titles, adding items to the cart, and checking out. The **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern is used to organize the code, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## Technologies Used
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **Java**: Programming language used for scripting.
- **TestNG**: Test framework for managing and executing test cases.
- **Maven**: Build automation and dependency management.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Design pattern for organizing code.
- **Git**: Version control system.

## Features
- Automated browsing of book categories.
- Search functionality for specific books.
- Adding books to the cart.
- Simulating the checkout process.
- Logging and reporting for test execution.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Maven (for dependency management)
- ChromeDriver (or any other WebDriver compatible with your browser)
- An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasminakterr/Web-Automation-of-Prothoma-Bookshop-Website-Using-Page-Object-Model.git

2. **Install dependencies**:
Maven will automatically download the required dependencies specified in the pom.xml file.

3. **Download WebDriver**:

- Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).
- Ensure the WebDriver executable is in your system's PATH or specify its location in the project configuration.

## Test Reports
By default, Maven generates test reports in the `target/surefire-reports` directory. You can find the following files:
test.xml: Test results in XML format.
*.txt: Text-based test output.

For more detailed reporting, you can integrate `ExtentReports` into my project.
